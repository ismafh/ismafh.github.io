My name Ismael and I'm currently finishing a Computer Science bachelor. I've been interested in programming and computers since I was 10 when my grandfather showed me his first computer. 

I'm also very interested in ***CyberSecurity*** and I've been "studying" and investigating by my own for the last year.

I mostly enjoy doing backend but I don't mind doing frontend. My most experienced languages are ***Java***, ***python*** and ***bash***. I've used many more languages but it was just once for a project and I've never been interested or I wasn't required to know more about them but I'm always open to learn more.

Right now I'm doing an Internship at F1-Connecting in Valencia, Spain. I mostly use ***php***, ***JS*** , ***bash*** and ***SQL*** but sometimes I also develop some ***python scripts*** for internal use. I've also helped developing a Telegram integration for the Hotline system where people can contact us sending a Telegram message and it will be saved and delievered to any of the free Hotline agents.

That's a very short summary of everything I've done, anyways feel free to contact me via mail.

Oh and I forgot, I'm a linux enjoyer. Thx for visiting!! :-)
